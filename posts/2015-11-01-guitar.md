Did a lot of technique work today. Fuck, playing acoustic is frustrating. Even scales feel messier on acoustic. My barre chords are still really sloppy and my hands get really tired while working on them. I spent almost the whole session today working on technique.  I finished up by starting to figure out the chords to Pistol by Dustin Kensure.
