Back to the acoustic. Lots of warmups, again based off of http://thebestguitarlessons.com/guitar-practice-routine/  Still working on cleaner chords. Then tried my ear at some Frank Turner. Got really frustrated with I Knew Prufrok Before... and started working on Long Live The Queen. My ear still needs lots of work, too.
