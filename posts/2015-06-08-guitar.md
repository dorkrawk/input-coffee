Warmed up a bit focusing on clean scales and clean chord shapes.

Worked on I Will Follow You Into the Dark more. Seeing progress. Need to focus on proper picking and cleaning up the Fm shape.

Went back and played Divorce In the American South.  Needed to re-figure out some of the progressions (which was good ear training) but remembered it pretty well. Haven't played it much since recording it.
