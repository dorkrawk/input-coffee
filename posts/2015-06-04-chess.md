I spent tonight working with Chess Fundamentals a bit more. I focused on a K,B,B vs K ending. To mix things up I actually pulled out my real board and pieces and went through the ending on that rather than using a digital board. It was nice to use actual pieces.

This book is very dense and the descriptive notation is still slow to read (compared with algebraic notation) but I'm working with it.
