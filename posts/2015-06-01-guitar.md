Lots more work on I Will Follow You Into the Dark. Figured out the 2 chords out of the 3rd verse ("the blackest of mooooooooons") and the outro. Then really worked on cleaning up my F and Fm barre chords.

I'm really struggling with the fact that I've played guitar for so long but I can't play something as fundamental as a clean, buzz-free F barre chord. I don't play acoustic very much and I can really feel the fatigue in my hands/arm after playing for a hour. I guess it just takes practice.

To break things up a bit I relearned the chords to Nirvana's Sappy. Really easy to figure out and a good way to focus on clean power chords.
