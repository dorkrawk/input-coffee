Worked on learning I Will Follow You Into The Dark by Death Cab by ear. This is something I've never really worked on enough and I still struggle with it. It went pretty well but I got completely stuck on the Fm in the intro/chorus. I could pick out a few of the notes but because it was out of key it really threw me.

I had a bit of an advantage on this song because I played it a while ago (from tabs) and I knew that capoing it somewhere would give me a better positioning than trying to play it open, but that was years ago and I had forgotten a lot of how the song went.
