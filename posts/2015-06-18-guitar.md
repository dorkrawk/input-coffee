So I spent the first half of this session practicing some older songs; Divorce and the American Sount and I Will Follow You, then focused on Everlong more. I need to clean up barred power chord shapes so those are always clean.

Then I plugged in my SG and worked on "re-learning" some American Autumn songs. I worked on She Likes The Radio and You're So Speechless. A lot of it came back pretty quickly but I had to use my ear a bit. These songs are still really fun to play
