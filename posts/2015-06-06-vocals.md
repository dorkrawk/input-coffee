Worked on I Will Follow You Into the Dark vocals. Did a lot of recording myself and listening back.  I haven't done formal vocal work in a while so it was good to get back into this.

I noticed that I get tired from singing for a full song. My voice just gives out. I need to work on this strength and make sure my form is right.
