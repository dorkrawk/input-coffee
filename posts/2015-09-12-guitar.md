I plugged in my Mesa today and played through that for the first time in a REALLY long time. It felt good and I forgot how nice it sounds. Did some warmups focusing on scales and clean chord changes then spent most of the time getting Bleed American cleaner. Spent a bit of time on The Kids Are Right, too.
