Started this session working with I Will Follow You Into The Dark. Just trying to get it cleaner. Still messing up the progression when playing along with the song and I need to work on picking. Still a good test for clean F and Fm shapes.

Then worked on Everlong. Figured out the right chord positions for the main riff and everything really came together much faster after that. Worked out the chorus part and and I'm now just trying to make sure everything sounds clean. Need to work on getting some of the transitions exactly right too, but much better than the last time I was working on this song.
