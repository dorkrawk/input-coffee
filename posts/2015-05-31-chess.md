Today I found Capablanca's "Chess Fundamentals" at a used bookstore. I started working through it tonight. All of the moves are written in descriptive notation, rather than algebraic, which makes it a little tougher to read, but I'm working through it. It helps to play the positions out on a practice board. I'm using the chess.com one for now.
