Brief warmup then played through I Will Follow You Into The Dark. Worked on singing along with the record while playing. I'm still not great at singing and playing at the same time. Did some work on Everlong. Trying to clean up chorus chords. Tried to sing a bit but the picking still gets off when I do.
